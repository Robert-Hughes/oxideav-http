//! HTTP/HTTPS source driver for oxideav.
//!
//! Implements `Read + Seek` over HTTP `Range` requests so any container
//! demuxer that takes a `Box<dyn BytesSource>` can read directly from a
//! URL. Servers must support `Range: bytes=…` (most static-file hosts
//! do; we verify with a `HEAD` at construction).
//!
//! Wire it into a [`oxideav_core::RuntimeContext`] with [`register`]:
//! both `http` and `https` register as bytes-shape sources, so
//! `ctx.sources.open(uri)` yields `SourceOutput::Bytes(_)`. For callers
//! that hold a bare [`oxideav_source::SourceRegistry`] use
//! [`register_source`] directly.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! let mut ctx = oxideav_core::RuntimeContext::new();
//! oxideav_http::register(&mut ctx);
//! let _r = ctx.sources.open("https://example.com/clip.mp4").unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Configuring the underlying agent
//!
//! By default the driver uses a process-wide agent. To tighten policy
//! (redirect following/cap/scheme/host restrictions, custom
//! `User-Agent`, timeouts, https-only mode) build an [`HttpConfig`]
//! and either:
//!
//! 1. Install it once at startup with [`install_default_config`], so
//!    every `ctx.sources.open("http://…")` call honours it; or
//! 2. Open a one-off source with [`HttpSource::open_with_config`],
//!    leaving the registry-default agent untouched.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! let cfg = oxideav_http::HttpConfig::builder()
//!     .max_redirects(5)
//!     .user_agent("my-app/1.0")
//!     .https_only(true)
//!     .build();
//! oxideav_http::install_default_config(cfg).ok();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Driver-owned redirects (RFC 9110 §15.4 / §10.2.2, RFC 3986 §5)
//!
//! The driver follows 3xx redirects itself — the transport layer
//! hands every 3xx back unfollowed. `Location` is parsed as a
//! URI-reference and resolved against the current target URI with the
//! RFC 3986 §5 machinery in [`uri`]. Permanent hops (301/308) rewrite
//! the URI future range GETs target; temporary hops (302/307) are
//! re-walked per request; a 303 at open rebases the anchor to its
//! target (§15.4.4: the original resource has no transferable
//! representation), while a 303 during a range-anchored GET is fatal.
//! Policy knobs: [`HttpConfigBuilder::follow_redirects`],
//! [`HttpConfigBuilder::max_redirects`] (+ `max_redirects_will_error`),
//! [`HttpConfigBuilder::redirect_scheme_policy`], and
//! [`HttpConfigBuilder::redirect_same_host_only`]. Cyclical
//! redirections are detected over §4.2.3-normalized URIs, and hostile
//! `Location` values (userinfo per §4.2.4, empty host, out-of-grammar
//! bytes, non-http(s) schemes, multiple field lines) are refused with
//! precise cites. `Range` / `If-Range` ride along on every hop, so
//! the §13.1.5 validator guards whichever origin finally answers.
//!
//! ## Mid-stream mutation detection (RFC 9110 §13.1.5)
//!
//! When the origin's `HEAD` reply carries a STRONG validator (an ETag
//! without the `W/` weakness prefix, or a `Last-Modified` whose
//! companion `Date` header is at least one second later — the §8.8.2.2
//! promotion rule), every subsequent `Range: bytes=N-` GET is sent
//! with `If-Range: <validator>`. Per §13.1.5 the server then EITHER
//! satisfies the range (`206 Partial Content` — happy path) OR ignores
//! `Range` and returns the full new representation (`200 OK`). The
//! driver treats the latter as a fatal mid-stream-mutation error
//! rather than silently re-anchoring the byte offset against a
//! different resource.
//!
//! ## Transparent resume after transport drops (RFC 9110 §14.2)
//!
//! §14.2 motivates byte ranges with "efficient recovery from partially
//! failed transfers": when a response body is truncated or the
//! connection drops mid-stream, the driver re-requests
//! `Range: bytes=<current-pos>-` and splices the remainder — up to
//! [`HttpConfigBuilder::read_retries`] times per `read` call (default
//! 2, `0` disables). The resume GET carries `If-Range` whenever a
//! strong validator exists, so a representation that mutated between
//! the drop and the resume is refused (§13.1.5), never spliced.
//!
//! ## Seek-via-Range
//!
//! `Seek` maps onto fresh `Range: bytes=<target>-` GETs, with one
//! economy: a forward hop of at most
//! [`HttpConfigBuilder::seek_drain_max`] bytes (default 64 KiB) that
//! stays inside the live body's declared span is satisfied by
//! draining the open connection instead of a new request — demuxers
//! skip small box/frame payloads constantly, and a request round trip
//! per few-byte hop is the exact waste RFC 9110 §14.2's efficiency
//! rationale warns against, in the other direction.
//!
//! ## HEAD-hostile servers (opt-in `range_probe`)
//!
//! Some origins answer HEAD with 405/501, omit Content-Length on HEAD
//! (explicitly permitted by RFC 9110 §9.3.2), or never advertise
//! `Accept-Ranges` (§14.3 keeps the header advisory and lets clients
//! probe anyway). With [`HttpConfigBuilder::range_probe`] enabled the
//! driver falls back to a `Range: bytes=0-` GET: a 206 proves range
//! support, its Content-Range supplies the complete-length (§14.4),
//! and its body becomes the initial read stream — a successful probe
//! costs no extra request. A 200 (server ignored `Range`, §14.2 MAY)
//! is refused; a 416 with `bytes */0` yields an empty source (§14.1.2
//! makes `bytes=0-` unsatisfiable against a zero-length
//! representation, so that 416 is range support working correctly).

// internal — redirect-engine URI machinery; not part of the stable API

///   (case preservation is the caller's job per §5.6.6's "Parameter
///   values might or might not be case-sensitive, depending on the
///   semantics of the parameter name"); when the value is

///   `quoted-pair` is collapsed per §5.6.4's MUST and the consumer
///   receives the logical octet sequence (boundaries, charsets, realms)
///   ready to pattern-match.
/// - **No whitespace around `=`**: §5.6.6's informational note says
///   "Parameters do not allow whitespace (not even 'bad' whitespace)
///   around the '=' character." A parameter that has SP / HTAB before
///   or after `=` is skipped (not a list-fatal reject), matching the
///   "ignore the bad slot" defensive posture.
/// - **Missing `=`**: a slot like `; foo` (token with no `=value` tail)
///   is skipped — §5.6.6's `parameter = parameter-name "=" parameter-value`
///   makes the `=` a required production; some §8.3.1 in-the-wild
///   senders strip the value, but recipients here decline to invent one.
/// - **Quoted-string boundary**: the `;` split honours quoted-strings —
///   a `;` inside a `"…"` body (e.g. `boundary="a;b"`) is not a slot
///   terminator. Backslash escapes inside the quoted-string are
///   respected by the splitter (so `"a\";b"` reads the `\"` as a
///   quoted-pair and continues past it).
/// - **Optional leading `;`**: callers that hand the tail starting from
///   the first byte after the main item (which is usually `;` but can be
///   `OWS ;`) get the same result as callers that hand the tail starting
///   from the OWS-stripped post-`;` position; the function consumes

///
/// Returns an empty `Vec` for empty / whitespace-only / `;`-only inputs.

///
/// The disambiguation rule this parser applies, after a quoted-string-
/// aware top-level comma split (§5.6.1 `#`-list, so a comma inside a
/// `"…"` value never splits): each list element is classified as either
///
/// - a **bare `auth-param`** (`token BWS "=" …`) — it has NO scheme of
///   its own, so it attaches to the challenge currently being built; or
/// - a **challenge head** (`auth-scheme` alone, or `auth-scheme 1*SP
///   <arg>`) — it starts a new challenge.
///
/// An element is a bare `auth-param` when its first `token` is
/// immediately followed (modulo §11.2 BWS around `=`) by `=` with no
/// intervening `1*SP` scheme/argument boundary. Everything else opens a
/// new challenge, whose first whitespace-delimited token is the
/// `auth-scheme` and whose remainder (if any) is the first `token68` or
/// first `auth-param`.
///
/// ## Token68 vs auth-param within a challenge
///
/// §11.2's `token68` may end in `*"="`, which collides with the
/// `auth-param` `=`. The parser treats a challenge argument as
/// `token68` only when it is one whitespace-free run whose body is all
/// `token68` characters with any `=` confined to a trailing pad run AND
/// it is not of `name=value` `auth-param` shape; otherwise the
/// remainder is parsed as the `#auth-param` list. Once a challenge has
/// committed to `auth-param`s, subsequent bare `auth-param` elements
/// attach to it.
///
/// ## Robustness
///
/// Matching the rest of the driver's §5.6.1 list handling, malformed
/// pieces are skipped rather than failing the whole parse: an empty
/// list element (the §11.6.1 "comma, whitespace, comma" note calls this
/// harmless), an `auth-param` slot that is not `token = (token /
/// quoted-string)`, or a leading bare `auth-param` with no challenge to
/// attach to are all dropped while the surrounding well-formed
/// challenges survive. An `obs-fold` (RFC 7230 §3.2.4) anywhere in the
/// value is normalised to a single SP before parsing.
